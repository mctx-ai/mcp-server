            ## Squash Merge Workflow

            This repo uses **squash merging**. Each PR becomes a single commit on `main`.

            **Your PR title becomes the commit subject line.** Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) format:

            ```
            type: short description
            ```

            **Your PR description becomes the commit body.** Use it to explain the why.

            ### Version Bumps

            | Prefix | Release |
            |--------|---------|
            | `feat:` | Minor (0.**X**.0) |
            | `fix:`, `perf:`, `revert:` | Patch (0.0.**X**) |
            | `chore:`, `docs:`, `ci:`, `test:`, `refactor:`, `style:`, `build:` | No release |
            | `BREAKING CHANGE` or `feat!:`, `fix!:`, etc. | Major (**X**.0.0) |

            > Note: commit types like `chore:` and `docs:` do **not** trigger a release in this repo.
