# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

I take security seriously and appreciate your help protecting this project.

### Primary: GitHub Security Advisory (Recommended)

The easiest and most secure way to report a vulnerability is using GitHub's built-in private reporting feature:

1. Go to the [Security tab](https://github.com/mctx-ai/mcp-server/security) of this repository
2. Click **"Report a vulnerability"** button
3. Fill out the form with vulnerability details
4. Submit your report

Alternatively, you can [report directly here](https://github.com/mctx-ai/mcp-server/security/advisories/new).

### Fallback: Email

If GitHub's reporting feature isn't an option for you, email security@mctx.ai with details. I'll do my best to respond as quickly as possible and work with you on a fix.

### After Reporting

Please do not file public issues or pull requests for security concerns until we've had a chance to address them. Once the vulnerability is patched, I'll coordinate disclosure and credit you for the report.
